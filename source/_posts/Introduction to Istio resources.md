Istio is an open platform that provides a uniform way to connect, manage, and secure microservices. It supports managing traffic, enforcing access policies, and aggregating telemetry data, all without requiring changes to the actual services. This article will introduce the basic resources of Istio, including `Gateway`, `VirtualService`, `DestinationRule`, `ServiceEntry`, `Sidecar`, and `AuthorizationPolicy`.
